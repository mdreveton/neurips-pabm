This file contains the experiments for the paper
Optimal Graph Clustering without Edge Density Signals

appearing at NeurIPS 2026. 

Authors: Maximilien Dreveton, Siyu (Elaine) Liu, Matthias Grossglauser, Patrick Thiran.
Code by Maximilien Dreveton. 

The files 'simulations_synthetic.py' and 'simulations_real_graphs.py' contains the code to run the simulations for synthetic graphs and for real graphs, respectively.
For convenience, there is also two jupyter notebooks. 

All the datasets are included in the folder datasets.

The various clustering algorithms are implemented in 'clustering.py', 'greedySubspaceProjectionClustering.py' and 'thresholdedCosineSpectralClustering.py'.
